# Ray Trasing by Rust

<!-- memo -->
## ss\_2

I implemented program which generat \*\.ppm image file.

## ss\_3

I implemented 3-dimentional vector library and utility.

## ss\_4

I implemented struct Ray.

$$
\bm{P}(t) = \bm{A} + t\bm{b}
$$

## ss\_5

### shpere:

for point $\bm{P} = (x,y,z), \bm{C} = (C_x, C_y,C_z)$

$$
|\bm{P} - \bm{C}| = r
$$

If ray $\bm{P}(t) = \bm{Q} + t\bm{b}$ hit sphere, $\bm{P}(t)$ satisfies below.

$$
|\bm{P}(t) - \bm{C}| = r
$$

$$
|\bm{Q} + t\bm{d} - \bm{C}| = r
$$
